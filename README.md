## Development Status
The good news is that most of the features I wanted are in here!

The catch is that I haven't had a chance to write tests for everything yet, so some parts are definitely more stable than others. You might run into some flaky behavior. If you find a bug, please let me know by opening an issue! 

> See [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for upcoming tasks and planned improvements.

## Usability
- The server currently lacks a GUI, but the API can be used and tested via tools like Postman.
- sends rewards via API requests to the [MicrovoltsEmulator](https://github.com/SoWeBegin/MicrovoltsEmulator).
