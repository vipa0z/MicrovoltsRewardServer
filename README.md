## Development Status
The good news is that most of the features I wanted are in here!

The catch is that I haven't had a chance to write tests for everything yet, so some parts are definitely more stable than others. You might run into some flaky behavior. If you find a bug, please let me know by opening an issue!

## Compatibility
- The server is not plug and play yet but can be tested with tools like Postman.
- It is designed to send rewards via API requests to the [MicrovoltsEmulator](https://github.com/SoWeBegin/MicrovoltsEmulator).
